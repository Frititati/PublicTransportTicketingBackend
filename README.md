# Public Trasport Ticketing - Backend

Project for course "Web Application II"

System that allows managing public transportation ticketing and subscriptions. It should be used by several kinds of users:

- **Passengers**, that need to buy and use tickets and subscriptions as well as control the status of their position
- **Officers**, that can validate whether a travel document is valid or not for a given ride
- **Managers**, that need to have a dynamic picture of the usage of the transport system
